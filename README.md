## About Me
I am an assistant professor at Washington University Department of Pathology and Immunology working in HLA and immunogenetics. I recieved my MD/PhD from the University of Iowa, as part of the medical scientist training program. I was also a member of the Washington University Department of Pathology and Immunology dual residency and post-doc PSTP program. At WashU, I was co-mentored by Jon Brestoff and David DeNardo. My research focused on the use of innate cellular barcodes, such as mitochondrial genome and adaptive immune receptor sequences, to track immune responses and predict clinical outcomes.
